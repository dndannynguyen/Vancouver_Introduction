        <p class = "para"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver">Vancouver</a> is a big city situated in western Canada, part of the British Columbia's Lower Mainland area.
             With a population density that is the highest in Canada, it is also the most populous city in the province. As of 2021, 
             the population of Vancouver is 662,248. The metropolitan area of Greater Vancouver, which includes Fraser Valley, has a 
             population of 2.6 million and is the third largest in Canada. The population of the entire Lower Mainland region is over 3 
             million, and Vancouver has a population density of more than 5,700 people per square kilometer, making it the fourth most
              densely populated city in North America, following New York City, San Francisco, and Mexico City.

        According to the 2021 Canadian census conducted by Statistics Canada, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_largest_population_centres_in_Canada">
        Vancouver's population</a> was 662,248, living in 305,336 out
         of 328,347 total private dwellings, an increase of 4.9% from 2016. It is the eighth largest city in Canada and the fourth largest
          in Western Canada. It has a population density of 5,749.7/km2, making it the most densely populated Canadian municipality with 
          more than 5,000 residents. The Greater Vancouver census metropolitan area had a population of 2,642,825, a change of 7.3% 
          from 2016, making it the third-most populous metropolitan area in the country and the most populous in Western Canada.
           Approximately 75% of people living in the Metro Vancouver area live outside of Vancouver. Additionally, the 2021 census
            reported that 42.2% of Vancouver's population were immigrants, with the top countries of origin being China, Philippines, 
            Hong Kong, India, United Kingdom, Vietnam, Taiwan, United States, Iran, and South Korea.

    <h2 id = "vanBox"> ETHNICITY </h2>
    <p class = "para">Vancouver is known for its
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Metro_Vancouver">diverse neighborhoods</a>, 
         each with its own distinct character and ethnic makeup. Historically, the largest ethnic groups in the city 
         were those of English, Scottish, and Irish origins, and elements of British culture can still be seen in 
         certain areas. Germans were also a significant group until World War I led to anti-German sentiment. 
         Today, the largest visible ethnic group in Vancouver is Chinese, with a diverse community speaking various 
         dialects, including Cantonese and Mandarin. There are several neighborhoods with distinct ethnic commercial 
         areas, such as Chinatown, Punjabi Market, Little Italy, Greektown, and formerly Japantown. Since the 1980s, 
         immigration has increased and 49% of Vancouver's residents do not speak English as their first language. 
         Over 25% of the city's population is of Chinese heritage, with a high concentration of ethnic Chinese 
         residents in North America. Other significant Asian ethnic groups in Vancouver include South Asians, 
         who make up about 7% of the population. They have established a Little India (known as Punjabi Market) 
         and have a significant presence in the southeast quadrant of the city, particularly in the Sunset 
         neighborhood before moving to outer suburbs like Surrey or Delta.

    <h2 id = "vanBox">TRANSPORTATION</h2>
    <p class = "para"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tram">Vancouver's streetcar</a> system was established on June 28, 1890, running from the
         Granville Street Bridge to Westminster Avenue. The Westminster and Vancouver Tramway Company soon after
         began operating Canada's first interurban line between the two cities and extended it to Chilliwack
        in 1910. Another line, the Vancouver and Lulu Island Railway, was leased by the Canadian Pacific
        Railway to the British Columbia Electric Railway in 1905, running from the Granville Street Bridge
         to Steveston via Kerrisdale, which helped spur development in residential neighborhoods outside 
        the city center. The British Columbia Electric Railway (BCER) operated the urban and interurban
         rail system from 1897 until 1958, when the system was replaced with trolley and gasoline/diesel
         buses. The BCER then became the core of the newly created, publicly-owned BC Hydro. Currently,
         Vancouver has the second-largest trolleybus fleet in North America, following San Francisco.</p>

    <p class = "para">In the 1970s and 1980s, city councils in Vancouver implemented a long-term plan which 
        prohibited the construction of freeways. As a result, the only major freeway within the city limits is
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia_Highway_1">Highway 1</a>, which passes through the northeastern corner of the city. Despite population growth and an
         increase in the number of cars, the rate of car ownership and the average distance driven by dail
         commuters have decreased since the early 1990s. Vancouver is the only major Canadian city with this
         trend. Despite an increase in journey time per vehicle and growing traffic volume, there are 7% fewer
         cars making trips into the downtown area. In 2012, Vancouver had the worst traffic congestion in Canada 
         and the second-worst in North America, behind Los Angeles. As of 2013, Vancouver now has the worst
         traffic congestion in North America. This trend is partly due to city planning efforts to reduce
         traffic and promote environmental campaigns, which have made it more difficult and expensive to
         commute by car, and more beneficial to use mass transit and cycling.</p>

    alt="Transit in Vancouver">
    <p class="para"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TransLink_(British_Columbia)">TransLink</a> is responsible for the management of roads and public transportation within 
        Metro Vancouver, taking over the functions of BC Transit, which had previously taken over the transit 
        functions of BC Hydro. It offers services such as bus service, including the RapidBus express service, 
        a passenger and bicycle ferry service (SeaBus), an automated rapid transit service called SkyTrain, 
        and a commuter rail service called West Coast Express. As of 2017, Vancouver's SkyTrain system operates 
        on three lines, the Millennium Line, the Expo Line, and the Canada Line, with a total of 53 stations. 
        However, only 20 of these stations are located within the city limits of Vancouver, with the remaining 
        stations in adjacent suburbs. Several of the city's major tourist attractions, including English Bay, 
        Stanley Park, the Vancouver Aquarium, the University of British Columbia, the Museum of Anthropology, 
        and Kitsilano, are not currently connected to this rapid transit system.</p>
